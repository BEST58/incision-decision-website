                <h3> Drive Train </h3>
                    <p> The robot has two 8.5 inch wheels at the back and also has two custom-made caster wheels at the front of the base. The robot was programmed to have enhanced driving controls which allows the driver to switch the driving mode from tank control to arcane control. The Driver can also drive using precision control, which limits the speed of the robot by 50%. Precision Control allows the driver to move slowly and make minimal movements in areas that require accuracy. </p>

            <div class="section">
                <h3> Elevator </h3>
                    <p> The elevator pulls the surgical tool adapter up and down. The frame was built using PVC pipes and there is a motor attached to the sliding forklift platform that pulls the platform up and down using a string. The surgical tool adapter is also attached to the platform. The buttons of the controller were programmed to control the movement of the elevator. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h3> Surgical Tool Adapter </h3>
                    <p> The surgical tool holder is made of ¾ inch PVC pipe and has been modified so that the ½ inch PVC pipe adapter on the surgical tools fits inside it. The buttons on the controller were programmed to control the rake to move in and out. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h3> Biowaste Collector and Disposal </h3>
                    <p> Situated at the front of the robot, right underneath the arm, with an outward-facing and slanted side, the biowaste bucket utilizes the field’s surrounding walls for waste disposal, eliminating the use of many moving and electronic parts such as motors and servos this rules out the chance of having any errors and maximizes the capabilities of the robot. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h3> Brain Biopsy Autonomous Retrieval </h3>
                    <p> This tool was designed to retrieve biopsies which allows to perform 2 biopsies simultaneously and it was designed to be modified so that 4 biopsy locations can be used. The team plans to communicate with the surgical partner team to determine ways to maximize the group points. </p>
